My goal is to turn ISBN numbers into a library catalogue.  If I were really ambitious I would want a script to take an ISBN number, look it up on the Library of Congress site, take their MARC file or whatever data format they had, reformat that data into a catalogue, and write a UI for someone to search the catalogue and/or a UI for a librarian to add one or more ISBN numbers.  As my advisor told me, I could just do parts of that project, but I'm definitely excited about attempting it.  So that's what I have so far.
