Wikipedia claims this project has the goal of “one web page per book” and gets its data from many websites including the Library of Congress.  The above API page looks promising.

“Optional parameter which specifies the response format. Possible values are json and javascript. The default format is javascript.“

e.g. 'https://openlibrary.org/api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:0201558025,LCCN:93005405&format=json'
